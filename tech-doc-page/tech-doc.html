                        <p><span class="highlight">JavaScript</span> is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Client-side</b> JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                            <li><b>Server-side</b> JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h2 id="prerequisites"><a href="#prerequisites" title="Permalink to Prerequisites" class="id-link">Prerequisites</a></h2>
                        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A general understanding of the <span class="highlight">Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</span></li>
                            <li>Good working knowledge of <span class="highlight">HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</span></li>
                            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 id="javascript-&-java"><a href="#javascript-&-java" title="Permalink to JavaScript and Java" class="id-link">JavaScript and Java</a></h3>
                        <p><b>JavaScript</b> and <b>Java</b> are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>In contrast to <span class="highlight">Java's compile-time system</span> of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a <span class="highlight">runtime system</span> based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model.</p>
                        <p><span class="highlight">The prototype-based model</span> provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

                        <h3 id="hello-world"><a href="#hello-world" title="Permalink to Hello World!" class="id-link">Hello World!</a></h3>
                        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello World" JavaScript code:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">function</span> greetMe(yourName) { <br> <span class="red">alert</span>(<span class="green">"Hello "</span> + yourName); <br> } <br>greetMe(<span class="green">"World"</span>);</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h2 id="variables"><a href="#variables" title="Permalink to Variables" class="id-link">Variables</a></h2>
                        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
                        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a <span class="highlight">letter</span>, <span class="highlight">underscore</span> (_), or <span class="highlight">dollar sign</span> ($); subsequent characters can also be <span class="highlight">digits</span> (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>
                        <h3 id="declare"><a href="#declare" class="id-link">Declaring Variables</a></h3>
                        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                        <p>With the keyword <span class="code">var</span>. For example,</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">var</span> x = <span class="green">42</span></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
                        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p>x = <span class="green">42</span></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
                        <p>With the keyword <span class="code">let</span>. For example,</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">let</span> y = <span class="green">13</span></p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h2 id="scope"><a href="#scope" title="Permalink to Variable Scope" class="id-link">Variable Scope</a></h2>
                        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a <span class="highlight">global variable</span>, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a <span class="highlight">local variable</span>, because it is available only within that function.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log <span class="code">5</span>, because the scope of <span class="code">x</span> is the function (or global context) within which <span class="code">x</span> is declared, not the block, which in this case is an <span class="code">if</span> statement.</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">if</span> (true) { <br> <span class="red">var</span> x = <span class="green">5</span>; <br> } <br> <span class="blue">console.log</span>(x); // <span class="green">5</span></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>This behavior changes, when using the <span class="code">let</span> declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">if</span> (true) { <br> <span class="red">let </span>y = <span class="green">5</span>; <br> } <br> <span class="blue">console.log</span>(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</p>
                        </div>
            
                        <h3 id="global"><a href="#global" title="Permalink to Global Variables" class="id-link">Global Variables</a></h3>
                        <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the <span class="code">window.variable</span> syntax.</p>
                        <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called <span class="code">phoneNumber</span> is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as <span class="code">parent.phoneNumber</span>.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h2 id="constants"><a href="#constants" title="Permalink to Constants" class="id-link">Constants</a></h2>
                        <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the <span class="code">const</span> keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">const</span> PI = <span class="green">3.14</span>;</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                        <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
                        <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR <span class="blue">function</span> f() {}; <span class="red">const</span> f = <span class="green">5</span>; <br> // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO <span class="blue">function</span> f() { <span class="red">const</span> g = <span class="green">5</span>; <span class="red">var</span> g; //statements }</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">const</span> MY_OBJECT = {<span class="red">"key"</span>: <span class="green">"value"</span>}; <br> MY_OBJECT.<span class="red">key</span> = <span class="green">"otherValue"</span>;</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h2 id="data-types"><a href="#data-types" title="Permalink to Data Types" class="id-link">Data Types</a></h2>
                        <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">Boolean.</span> true and false.</li>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">null.</span> A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">undefined.</span> A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">Number.</span> 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">String.</span> "Howdy"</li>
                                    <li><span class="highlight">Symbol</span> (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>and <span class="highlight">Object</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h2 id="if...else"><a href="#if...else" title="Permalink to If...Else Statement" class="id-link">If...Else Statement</a></h2>
                        <p>Use the <span class="code">if</span> statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional <span class="code">else</span> clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">if </span>(condition) { <br> <span class="red">statement_1</span>; <br> } <span class="blue">else</span>{ <br> <span class="red">statement_2</span>; <br> }</p>
                        </div>
                        <p><span class="code">(condition)</span>can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, <span class="code">statement_1</span> is executed; otherwise, <span class="code">statement_2</span> is executed. <span class="code">statement_1</span> and <span class="code">statement_2</span> can be any statement, including further nested if statements.</p>
                        <p>You may also compound the statements using <span class="code">else if</span> to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">if </span>(condition_1) { <br> <span class="red">statement_1</span>;<br> } <span class="blue">else if </span>(condition_2) { <br> <span class="red">statement_2</span>; <br> } <span class="blue">else if </span>(condition_n) { <br> <span class="red">statement_n</span>; <br> } <span class="blue">else </span>{ <br> <span class="red">statement_last</span>; <br> }</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement (<span class="code">{ /* statements here */ }</span>) . In general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">if </span>(condition) { <br> <span class="red">statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true</span>; <br> <span class="red">statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true</span>; <br> } <span class="blue">else </span>{ <br> <span class="red">statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_true</span>; <br> <span class="red">statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_true</span>; <br> }</p> 
                        </div>
                        <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">if </span>(x = y) { <br> /* <span class="red">statements here</span> */ <br> }</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">if </span>((x = y)) { <br> /* <span class="red">statements here</span> */ <br> }</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h2 id="while"><a href="#while" title="Permalink to While Statement" class="id-link">While Statement</a></h2>
                        <p>A <span class="code">while</span> statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">while </span>(condition) { <br> /* <span class="red">statements here</span> */ <br> }</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.</p>
                        <p>The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is passed to the statement following while.</p>
                        <p>To execute multiple statements, use a block statement (<span class="code">{ /* statements here */ }</span>) to group those statements.</p>
                        <p>Example: <br> The following <span class="code">while</span> loop iterates as long as <span class="code">n</span> is less than three: </p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">var</span> n = <span class="green">0</span>; <br> <span class="blue">var</span> x = <span class="green">0</span>; <br> <span class="blue">while</span> (n < 3) { <br> <span class="red">n++</span>; <br> <span class="red"r>x</span> += <span class="red">n</span>; <br> }</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>With each iteration, the loop increments <span class="code">n</span> and adds that value to <span class="code">x</span>. Therefore, <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">n</span> take on the following values:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After the first pass: <span class="code">n = 1</span> and <span class="code">x = 1</span></li>
                            <li>After the second pass: <span class="code">n = 2</span> and <span class="code">x = 3</span></li>
                            <li>After the third pass: <span class="code">n = 3</span> and <span class="code">x = 6</span></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>After completing the third pass, the condition <span class="code">n < 3</span> is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="info-card">
                        <h2 id="functions"><a href="#functions" title="Permalink to Function Declarations" class="id-link">Function Declarations</a></h2>
                        <p>A <span class="code">function</span> definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The name of the function.</li>
                            <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                            <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, <span class="code">{ }</span>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="blue">function</span> square(number) { <br> <span class="red">return</span> number * number; <br> }</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>The function square takes one argument, called <span class="code">number</span>. The function consists of one statement that says to <span class="code">return</span> the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The <span class="code">return</span> statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
                        <div class="code-card">
                            <p><span class="red">return</span> number * number;</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>Primitive parameters (such as a <span class="code">number</span>) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
                    </div>
