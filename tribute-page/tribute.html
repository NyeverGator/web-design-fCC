                        Born on Oct. 29, 1866 in Binondo, Manila, Luna was a trained professional scientist.
                        At an early age, he showed expertise in science, especially chemistry. 
                        This was not lost to his Jesuit mentors at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now known as Ateneo de Manila University).
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="info__p">
                        Aside from these, Antonio Luna took a variety of specializations, which became part of the history of the Philippines.
                        He used his knowledge in studying and researching on military science, tactics, field fortifications, battalion tactics, national defense and organization in preparation for fighting in the Revolution.

                    <br>
                    <p class="info__p info__p--margin">
                        Though he had great knowledge, he became a victim of factionalism and was assassinated in Cabanatuan by Filipino soldiers on June 5, 1899.
                        He died at an early age of 32 but will be remembered with his words for the liberation of his homeland.
